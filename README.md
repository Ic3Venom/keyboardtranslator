# keyboardtranslator
Translates a piece of text into another keyboard layout

Currently supports the following layouts (may not ever add any more myself):

1. Qwerty layout
2. Dvorak layout
3. Colemak layout
4. Workman layout

TODO:
- automatically detect what layout the text is from
- add user's own keyboard layouts for translation
